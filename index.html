			<h2>Mathematics</h2>
			<p> In the fall of 2018, I'll be taking point-set topology, and plan to do some reading of my own on commutative algebra. My mathematical interest are in mathematical music theory, the foundations/philosophy of mathematics, and algebraic geometry.</p>

			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>I study the bassoon with Amy Pollard. I play in the Orchestra and Wind Ensemble at UGA, and gig around Athens. I make and sell reeds for myself and students. You're welcome to contact me if you're interested.</p>
